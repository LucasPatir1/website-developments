        2) dom can make your web page
        
        DOM can be changed on two ways.
        1) direct change
            directly change the dom as a 
            html developer. give some 
            style to it
            it needed recompilation

        2) through using javascript
            change the dom using javascript
            the change will be dynamically.
            no need of recompilation
